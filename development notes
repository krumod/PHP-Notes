1) Different betweeb project and product.
In this case , minor different in both. 
project contains specific requirement of specific customer.
product contains specific requirement of customer groups like CRM.

2) Types of error:
Error : Any kind of human behaviour create problem in application.

Defect / Bug : If expected behaviour not match with actual behaviour of application. In simple word, actual event not match with customer requirement.

Failure : It is not a error. It may be possible from different reason like server not responsing. In this problem in server configration, server resoures except programming.

3) Steps of SDFC Life cycle
->Requirement : Make notes of customer requirement.
->Design : It contain lot of things like database structure, Application front end and backend, Server side validation , client side validation. Here make all the notes of unit testing.
->Development : It is strongly recommended, If design related points will be completed then start development related task.
->Testing : If is important part of SDDC life cycle. Here, tester check application for specific requirement. If we follow above steps properly, Possiblity to increase productivity.

4) Verification and validation model
In development views. 
In Verification model , Make list of all the input with expected output and check all of this output is correct or not.
In validation model , This output contains expected validation or not.

5) Steps of STLC Life cycle
-> Requirement analysis
-> Test planning
-> Test case development
-> Test execution
-> Test cycle close? : Here , make sure that your application does not contain any error and bug.

-------------------------------------------------
Level of testing
-------------------------------------------------

6) Unit testing
In this teting , analyse all the input and output is expected  or not. here check all the flow will be executed or not.
Control structure contain all the condition is applied or not and check with expected output.
Loop structure contain all the loop for applied for get and set result and check with expected output.
Mutation testing verify all the result is expected or not at end of logic closing.

7) Integration testing
In this testing , checking data communication between related modules.
Top down , Bottom up approach useful for this.
->White box testing
It contains to check internal logic in correct or not. Here we check entire internal with input and expected output.

->Black box testing
It contains functionality working on customer requirements.

->Grey box testing
If combine of White box and Black box testing.

8) System testing
It contains testing overall functionality as per customer requirement.
